<h2>sudo for Windows Terminal</h2>
<p>The introduction of <strong>sudo</strong> in Windows Terminal is a boon for developers, partly for the frontend as
      well. This integration brings a UNIX-inspired practice to the Windows environment, allowing developers to execute
      elevated commands seamlessly.</p>
<p>This enhances the frontend experience by providing a straightforward and secure way to perform privileged operations
      directly from the terminal. With sudo, developers can now streamline their workflow, eliminating the need for
      cumbersome workarounds and fostering a more efficient and user-friendly development environment, without a need to
      jump into WSL solution.</p>

<h2>Tempo - an Easier Way to Work with Dates</h2>
<p>Tempo is a new library in a proud tradition of JavaScript date and time libraries. Inspired by the likes of
      moment.js, day.js, and date-fns, Tempo is built from the ground up to be as small and easy to use as possible —
      including first-class support for timezone operations.</p>
<p>Tempo is best thought of as a collection of utilities for working with the native <strong>Date</strong> object — an
      important distinction from other libraries that provide custom date primitives. Under the hood, Tempo mines
      JavaScript&#x27;s <strong>Intl.DateTimeFormat</strong> to extract complex data like timezones offsets and locale
      aware date formats, giving you a simple API to format, parse, and manipulate dates.</p>

<h2>LLRT (Low Latency Runtime) - Amazon's New JS Runtime</h2>
<p>Amazon has released an open-source runtime with a primary emphasis on achieving swift startups, catering specifically
      to ephemeral scenarios such as serverless computing, notably within the AWS Lambda environment.</p>
<p>The runtime leverages Fabrice Bellard&#x27;s <strong>QuickJS</strong> as its foundational engine, providing
      comprehensive support for nearly the entire ES2023 specification right from the initial setup.</p>

<h2>Storybook 8 Beta Released</h2>
<p>While Storybook&#x27;s latest iteration may still be in beta, the developers behind it are eager for users to dive in
      and explore its offerings. This updated version of the widely used UI component workshop brings forth several
      advantages for React developers, encompassing notably accelerated startup times, <strong>compatibility with React
            Server Components</strong>, and support for Vite 5 and Lit 3. Developers are encouraged to embrace these
      enhancements, signaling a proactive approach to fostering a more efficient and feature-rich development
      environment.</p>
