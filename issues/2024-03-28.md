### Redis shifts to stricter (non-open-source) license üîí

**Redis**, a prominent in-memory database vendor, is transitioning to a dual-license model with stricter terms, introducing the **Redis Source Available License (RSALv2)** and the **Server Side Public License (SSPLv1)** starting from version 7.4.

This change, reminiscent of similar shifts by **MongoDB** and **Elasticsearch**, has sparked concerns within the open-source community, following **Redis's** previous controversial licensing adjustments in 2018. The move away from its permissive BSD license raises questions about commercial use and aligns with industry trends aimed at curbing exploitation of open-source code.

Anticipated repercussions include **Redis** potentially being dropped by Linux distributors, though alternatives like **KeyDB** and **Microsoft's Garnet** exist. The shift underscores broader debates within the **FOSS** community about sustainability and monetization, with criticism directed at SSPL's clause 13, which mandates free access to service source code. This transition prompts reflections on the evolving definition of open-source licensing and the delicate balance between commercial viability and the ethos of open-source development.

### React will have its own compiler üò≥

**React 19** introduces several groundbreaking features, propelling the library's capabilities further. Key highlights include the **React Compiler**, which automates state management and UI updates, alleviating the need for manual optimizations like `useMemo()` and `useCallback()`. This compiler, named **React Forget**, streamlines the development process, particularly in handling re-renders. Additionally, **React Server Components**, a long-awaited feature, enable **SSR**, enhancing SEO and initial page load performance.

Furthermore, **React 19** introduces **Actions**, revolutionizing form interactions by allowing seamless integration of actions with HTML `<form/>` tags. This simplifies form submissions and eliminates the need for client-side-only actions. Moreover, the update brings significant improvements in asset loading, enabling assets like images and scripts to load asynchronously in the background, improving page load times and user experience. Lastly, new hooks like `use()`, `useFormStatus()`, `useFormState()`, and `useOptimistic()` enhance development by providing efficient ways to handle promises, form status, and optimistic UI updates. Overall, **React 19** marks a significant leap forward in React's evolution, promising smoother development experiences and better performance for developers and end-users alike.
